# New Harbor Watch

## Things To Consider

- write a list of goals, technical details, needs and wants for the new harbor watch
- create asana project
    - master project
    - subtasks
    - milestones
    - goals
    - TIMELINE/DUE DATES!!!
- wordpress template (can start with the new OCMDRestaurants template)
- we should get the designers to create a full site design and have an extensive review/rework process, that way we don't code the entire website and then decide it needs to be completely rebuilt
- take ideas from existing websites, apply them to what we want out of the new harbor watch

- i like how they did their menus
- html menus instead of pdfs
- quicker access to menus through menu tabs

[Phillips Seafood](https://phillipsseafood.com/locations/baltimore/)

- I like the 3 call to actions (half way down the page)
- these show what is most important to experience at the restaurant
- Also the testimonial is simple and it looks good

[NY Pizzeria](https://nypizzeria.com/)

- under the "taste of little italy" section, the different categories of food are highlighted
- this makes it easy to see what kinds of food the restaurant has instead of reading through an entire menu

[Quality Bistro](https://www.qualitybistro.com/)

- Kind of nice style where it's just one background image after another

[Uncle Gussy's](https://unclegussys.com/)

- "our specialty your favorites" highlights some key menu items
- also they have an "about" video
